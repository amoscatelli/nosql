== Introduction to the Mapping API

The mapping level, to put it differently, has the same goals as either the JPA or ORM. In the NoSQL world, the *OxM* then converts the entity object to a communication model.

This level is in charge to perform integration among technologies such as Bean Validation. The Mapping API has annotations that make the Java developerâ€™s life easier. As a communication project, it must be extensible and configurable to keep the diversity of NoSQL database.

To go straight and cover the four NoSQL types, this API has four domains:

* `jakarta.nosql.mapping.column`
* `jakarta.nosql.mapping.document`
* `jakarta.nosql.mapping.graph`
* `jakarta.nosql.mapping.keyvalue`

IMPORTANT: The package name might change on the Jakarta EE process.

=== The Mapping structure

The mapping API has five parts:

* The *persistence-core*: The mapping common project where there are annotations commons among the NoSQL types APIs.
* The *persistence-key-value*: The mapping to key-value NoSQL database.
* The *persistence-column*: The mapping to column NoSQL database.
* The *persistence-document*: The mapping to document NoSQL database.
* The *persistence-graph*: The mapping to Graph NoSQL database.

TIP: Each module works separately as a Communication API.

IMPORTANT: Similar to the communication API, there is a support for database diversity. This project has extensions for each database types on the database mapping level.

=== Template classes

The template offers convenient operations to create, update, delete, query, and provides a mapping among your domain objects and communication API. The templates classes have a goal to persist an Entity Model through a communication API. It has three components:

* *Converter*: That converts the Entity to a communication level API.
* *EntityManager*: The EntityManager for communication.
* *Workflow*: That defines the workflow when either you save or update an entity. These events are useful when you, e.g., want to validate data before being saved. See the following picture:
